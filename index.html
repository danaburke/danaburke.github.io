    <div id="about">

    <p>First and foremost, I am a wordsmith. I know when to use who and whom, the difference between that and which, and how to properly attribute in an article. The AP Stylebook is my bible. I aim to tell stories that are clear and accurate while being entertaining and informative.</p>
    <p>My creativity extends far beyond the letters A through Z. At 15, I received my first DSLR camera. Falling in love with photography, I enrolled in the commercial photography program at McFatter Technical Center. There I learned the ins and outs of film, studio lighting, digital photography and photo manipulation. I graduated as a certified photographer and an Adobe certified associate in visual communication.</p>
    <p>Combining my love of language with my passion for strong images, I am pursuing a degree in journalism at the University of Florida. Currently, I am the editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.oandbmagazine.com">UF's Orange & Blue Magazine</a>.</p>
    <p>This past summer, I spent my workdays between <a href="http://www.mtv.com">MTV</a> and <a href="http://www.townandcountrymag.com/">Town & Country magazine</a>, interning with the off-air creative team and the fashion editorial team, respectively. Previously, I worked at <a href="http://www.alligator.org">The Independent Florida Alligator</a>, the nation's largest student-run newspaper, as the entertainment editor and the photo editor. I have also worked for Ology Media, <a href="http://www.bocaratonobserver.com/">The Boca Raton Observer Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/teenlink/">Teenlink South Florida</a>, a publication of the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/">Sun Sentinel</a>.</p>
    <p>My resume can be viewed <a href="images/danaburke_site_resume.pdf">here</a>. Feel free to <a href="mailto:dana@danaburke.com">contact me</a> with any questions about my work, compliments on this hand-coded site, story ideas, job offers or online coupon codes (I'm a sucker for a good sale).</p>

<p>Off the record: In my free time, I run a small eBay business for extra cash. (Want to learn more? Check out my <a href="howto.html">how-to page</a>!) My favorite color is black. People watching is the best pastime. I'll never say no to cookies.</p>
