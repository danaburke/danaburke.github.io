    <p>When I was a writer at the Alligator, I often found myself taking on topics I knew nothing about: nutrition, engineering, jazz, meteorology, and everything in between. By the end of my roughly 500-word stories, I was a wealth of knowledge. Like any good journalist, I researched ahead of time, talked to the experts, studied the data and, most importantly, aimed to get it right. </p>
<p>During my junior year, I was writing a fashion column for the Avenue, the arts and entertainment section of the paper. Fashion is something I like to think I have already mastered, but there's always more to learn and explore within the topic. Instead of just spewing random trends and advice to my loyal readers, I wanted to do something different with the section. I began to profile designers, boutique owners and fashion events within the Gainesville community. </p>
<p>Searching high and low for people with unique style and fashion perspectives, I discovered a classmate of mine, Korrie Francis, ran her own eBay account. I thought it would make a great profile considering my audience was mostly college students, often broke and looking for quick ways to make cash. </p>
<p>After spending time with Korrie, picking her brain and watching her shop, I wrote a <a href="http://www.alligator.org/the_avenue/fashion/article_da3f7754-52d0-11e1-8a8c-0019bb2963f4.html">full-page feature</a> in the Avenue about how she turns her thrifting endeavors into cash using eBay. It seemed simple enough: Find an item, list it, wait for it to sell and — voilà! — it became easy money in your pocket. </p>
<p>With a full closet and empty wallet, I tried my hand at the online community retailer. I began to list clothes I never wore, things that took up valuable hanging space and items I knew would bring in the big bucks. Soon enough, I was making sales. I had a job at the time, so the money I made funded my shopping habit. Essentially I was selling things to make money to buy new things. </p>
<p>Fast-forward to now, almost two years since I originally wrote that article, and eBay is my main (read: only) source of income. I'm not rolling in the dough, but it helps pay my rent. I have sold over 200 items and am considered to be a "Top Rated Seller" because I have 100% feedback rating from my buyers.</p>
<p>In addition to selling my own clothes, my parents donated to the cause by cleaning out their closets and giving me what they had. I also provide this service for friends and split the profits with them. </p>
<p>On average, I am currently making $350 a month. Granted, since I am using the money to pay rent, I no longer have extra cash for shopping. I sometimes find that my closet is getting smaller with each sell. In order to still have a wardrobe, I shop for items at thrift stores, the mall or online to sell at a higher price. Like a person would flip a house, I flip clothes. Find a cute top on sale at the mall for $5? Sell it for $20, new with tags. After shipping you have probably made a $10 profit. </p>
<p>It's a great way to make money, but you have to put effort in to reap the benefits. My advice would be to start off slow listing only a few items and see how it goes. Selling online is not for everyone, but if you put in the time, you will start to see dollar signs.  </p>
<p>My most important tip for beginners: mail <strong>all items</strong> with a tracking number. Without it, you can be scammed out of your product and your profit. (It's happened to me before.) If a buyer says they never got the item and you don't have proof it was delivered, you have to refund your buyer 100% of what they paid and you don't get the item back. For 90 cents from the United States Postal Service, you can prevent this from happening from the start. </p>

<div id="tips">
<h3> I recently spoke to Korrie about running an eBay business. She taught me everything I know about flipping items for cash, and now, you can learn from her, too. Here are her top three tips:</h3>
<h4>1. Plan your shop’s content well </h4>
<p>It’s really important to create a strong, easily identifiable theme for your shop by targeting a particular customer base and setting a mission statement for your shop. Know who you want to purchase your items and keep that specific image of a customer in your mind. As I’d still consider myself an eBay beginner, I frequently stalk other shops that have a similar theme to one I’m striving to achieve. I analyze the particular language the owner’s use when describing items, the types of photos they include for each item and how they are using social media to spread awareness of the shop’s existence. The phrase “fake it ‘til you make it” undeniably has some merit in on eBay.</p><br/>

<h4>2. Think of the customer first </h4>
<p>When it comes to managing a shop of any kind, you have to shed bits of your ego and aim to always ensure dependable customer satisfaction, even if your customer dislikes an item that you believe has been described accurately and fairly. On eBay, your name is always attached to a tiny number that indicates your customer satisfaction rating. Arguably, this may be the holy grail of the eBay world as one bad incident with a customer can have a negative impact on your ability to sell in the future. If you believe a customer is being unreasonable, make sure to contact eBay customer service so that they can assist you.</p><br/>
<h4>3. Practice makes perfect </h4>
<p>Learning what works and what doesn’t work for your store takes practice, research, diligence and experimentation. At first, eBay seems pretty chaotic to newbies, but you get to learn the in’s and out’s of the site pretty quickly. The most successful shops have been operating for years, so just start with listing a few items and see how well they attract buyers. It’s important to take a deep breath, organize your goals and master one step of creating your shop at a time. It’s better to create an awesome shop in a longer period of time than end up with an disorganized shop that generates very little sales.</p>
